# Running the test suite — operator guide

This guide is for operators who want to check that the software works,
without needing to know how the tests are built. The technical companion is
[`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md).

## What the suite is

One command builds the software from this checkout, starts a complete
throwaway installation (its own database, its own containers — nothing
shared with anything you run), and exercises it the way real users would:
first-time setup, logging in as every kind of user (site administrator,
organization administrator, regular user), creating and managing
organizations, users, applications and settings, checking that every kind
of user is REFUSED the things they must not do, and finally resetting the
site administrator's password to prove customer data survives an admin
recovery. When it finishes, the throwaway installation is destroyed —
nothing is left behind, and nothing you have is touched.

## What you need

- Docker (running)
- This repository checked out next to its sibling `identuum-ui`
  (the folder layout: `identuum/identuum-idp-oss` and `identuum/identuum-ui`)
- `pnpm` installed in `identuum-ui` (`pnpm install` once)

## Run it

```bash
cd identuum-idp-oss
make test-full
```

It takes about 10 minutes and prints its progress phase by phase. All
passwords the run needs are generated fresh for that run and never shown.

## Reading the result

- **Green** — the run ends with lines like `gate-witness OK: … green on the
  tree it claims` and the command exits successfully. Everything the suite
  covers passed, including the safety floors (if a test quietly disappeared
  or coverage dropped, the run would FAIL — silence cannot hide a
  regression).
- **Red** — the command exits with an error and names the failing phase
  (for example `check OK: api-suite … failed=1` followed by the failing
  test's name and details). What to do:
  1. Run it once more. One known class of rare, transient failures exists
     (a session rejected mid-run under heavy load); a genuine bug fails
     both runs the same way.
  2. If it fails twice, save the printed output (and the
     `identuum-ui/GATE-RUN.e2e-full.txt` file, which records exactly what
     ran and what it saw) and report it. That file plus the printed failure
     is everything a developer needs to start.

## What the suite does NOT cover (known, recorded — not forgotten)

- **Backup / restore** — there is no product backup procedure yet to test;
  deferred until one is decided (see `TEST-spec-status.md`).
- **Commercial-edition (CE) features** — out of scope for this repository's
  suite by rule; the affected tests are skipped by name and counted, and
  the count may not grow.

## The promise

The suite runs on its own throwaway installation, built fresh and destroyed
at the end, both on success and on failure. It never reads or writes your
development database, your volumes, or your credentials.
